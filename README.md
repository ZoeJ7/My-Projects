Hi! This is a repository with various codes I have made throughout the oast few years. Here are some descriptions of all the projects here:

**mf_6.2.TyreModel**
This project is a tyre model I made in python for University of Toronto Formula Racing. This model uses python's pydantic library to takes in tyre data and apply it to the Magic Formula estimating
vertical and horizontal forces as well as moments acting on the tire. 

**Semantic Similarity**
This project was made for my python class ESC180. The function of the code is to find synonyms based off of sematic similarity between words and has an efficiency of 67.5 to 72.5%. 

**Seam Carving**
This project was made for my C class ESC190. This code recreates the "Seam Carving" function of Adobe's Photoshop. It takes in an image and resizes it without distorting the photo by removing pixels 
that have similar colours to those adjacent to it.
